| Product | Device type (Mobile Phone, Laptop) |
| Brand | Manufacturer (Dell, Apple, Asus, HP, etc.) |
| Price | Sale price in USD |
| Quantity Sold | Number of units sold |
| Region | Geographic location (Central, East, North, South, West) |
| Year | Year of sale |
| Product Specifications | RAM, SSD, Processor details |
